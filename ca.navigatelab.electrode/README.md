# Electrode the Game
Must run *copy-images.xml* as an ant build to copy images to the correct directory before launching the game. **If this is not done, the game will NOT run**.

Use the arrow keys to control Electrode. Motion controls can be used with the rasberry pi model B, but a complementary program must be downloaded on the rasberry pi such that the gyro values can be sent to the program running on a seperate device.
